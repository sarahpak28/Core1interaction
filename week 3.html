        <li>140g or 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter unsalted (cold is fine)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice plus more for topping</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>100g or 1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>100g or 1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>145g or 1/2 cup pumpkin butter store-bought or homemade</li>

    <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the pumpkin butter about an hour before making the cookie dough (see above recipe box for pumpkin butter recipe).</li>
            <li>Set the butter in a small frying pan over medium low heat. Once the butter has melted, raise the heat to medium. Cook, stirring often, as the butter sputters and the milk solids separate.</li>
            <li>With a rubber spatula, ensure to scrape the edges of the pan to ensure an even browning. Once the milk solids turn brown and the butter is almost done foaming, immediately remove it from the heat into a heat-safe bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the pumpkin spice, salt and vanilla to the butter and gently stir. It will bubble a bit. Let the butter cool for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in both sugars and then whisk for about 30-45 seconds, until the sugar and butter start to become cohesive.</li>
            <li>Add the egg yolk and whisk for a full 60 seconds. Add the pumpkin butter and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>If measuring the flour by cup, fluff it first with a fork then sprinkle it into the measuring cup and level the cup..</li>
            <li>Add the flour and baking soda to the bowl and use a rubber spatula to mix until no traces of dry flour can be seen.</li>
            <li>Set the bowl uncovered in the fridge for 30-45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F and line two greased cookie sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Stir together Â¼ cup granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.</li>
            <li>Use a cookie scoop to portion the dough into 2 tablespoons per cookie. Roll the dough between your palms then place it face down into the sugar, and swirl it around a bit, to coat.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies until lightly golden on the edges and cracked all over, about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
