        <h2 id="ingredients"> For the crust</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups (260 g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (151 g) unsalted butter, cold and cut into pieces</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons cold water</li>

        <h2 id="ingredients"> For the filling</h2>
            <li>2 cups finely chopped and peeled baking apples, about 2 apples</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li> 
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Stir with a whisk until well mixed.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry cutter or two knives cut the butter into the flour until lentil-sized crumbs form.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the ice water over the flour to moisten it. Toss the mixture together with a fork to combine. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and gently knead until the dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Flatten the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured work surface roll the dough into 1/6 inch thickness. Cut out 12, 4-inch circles. You will need to roll the dough out twice.</li>
        <h2 id="instructions">Make the filling</h2>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the apples, sugar, cinnamon, and allspice. Place a tablespoonful of filling on one side of each dough circle.</li>
            <li>Whisk the egg and water together in a small bowl. Brush eggwash around the edges of the pastries. Fold each one over and seal the edges with a fork.</li>
            <li>Place 2-inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops with the remaining eggwash. Cut three small slits in the tops of each pastry.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18-20 minutes, until golden brown. Cool on the pan for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
