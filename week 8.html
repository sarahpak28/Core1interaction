        <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>


            <li>12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips or chopped semi sweet chocolate</li>
            <li>16 ounces white chocolate chips or chopped white chocolate</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract</li>
            <li>3/4 cup crushed candy canes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the semisweet chocolate chips in a medium bowl and microwave for 30 second increments until melted. Stir until smooth.</li>
            <li>Spread the chocolate into a roughly 9″x 13″ rectangle on a piece of parchment paper. Place the chocolate in the fridge for 10 minutes to partially set. Do NOT go past 10 minutes in the fridge. The chocolate should be just set around the edges but still partially melted in the middle. If you let the semisweet layer harden completely, the white chocolate may not stick to it.</li>
            <li>Place the white chocolate chips in a medium bowl and microwave for 30 second increments until melted. Add the peppermint extract and stir until smooth. </li>
            <li>Spread the white chocolate over the semisweet chocolate layer. Top with candy canes. Let harden in the fridge for about 20 minutes or until the chocolate is completely set.</li>
            <li>Remove from the fridge and let the bark sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Use a straight edge chef's knife to cut the bark into pieces by cutting straight down through the layers of the bark. Serve and enjoy.</li>
